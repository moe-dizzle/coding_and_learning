# Part II - Creating Hight-Quality Code (ch 5-9) cool

## Chapter 5: Design in Construction

### 5.2 Design Problems

- design = messy, restricted, involves trial and error

### 5.3 Key Design Concepts

- main goal of software design = manage complexity
- good design = minimal complexity, maintainable, loose coupling, extensible, reusable
- divide program into meaningful subsystems
- abstractions = look at code at high level
- encapsulation = forces you to only stay on level
- information hiding
  - hide complexity
  - hide implementation, so changes are only local

## Chapter 6: Working Classes

### 6.1 Abstract Data Types (ADT)

- ADT = collection of data and operations that work on that data
- :thumbsup: of ADTs

  - hide implementation details
  - changes not affect whole program
  - make api more informative
  - **self-documentation**
  - don't have pass data everywhere

- Classes = ADT + inherence + polymorphism

### 6.2 Good Class Interfaces

- don't expose member data in public
- favor read convenience over write convenience
- program to interface not implementation

### 6.3 Design and Implementation Issues

- Containment ("has a" Relationship)
  - EX Employee "has a" name, phone number
  - more then 7 data members = split up the class more
- Inheritance ("is a" Relationship)
  - add complexity so it must be designed and documented or prohibited ie try to avoid
  - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) = derived class more specific version of base
  - avoid deep inheritance trees
- Law of Demeter = Obj `A` instanites an Obj `B`, then `A` can call `B` methods `A.B.method()` but if Obj `B` has an Obj `C` , `A` can't `A.B.C.method()` too deep

## Chapter 7: High-Quality Routines

### 7.1 Valid Reasons to Create a Routine

- well name routine = self-documentation
- don't be afraid to create small routines with a few lines of code
  - self-docs
  - hide operations as things get complex

### 7.2 Design at the Routine Level

- **_Functional cohesion_** = routines perform only one operation

### 7.3 Good routine names

- Describe what routine does
- for function -> use return val
- for procedure -> use verb + object
- make naming conventions when necessary

### 7.4 How long can a Routine be?

`¯\_(ツ)\_/¯`

- get diffcult after 200 lines

### 7.5 How to use Routine Paramaters

- be consistent
- put error/message/status variable last
- document param assumpts and use asserts

## Chapter 8 : Defensive programming

- program anticipating problems

### 8.1 Protecting Your Program from Invalid Inputs

- always check for bad data and handle

### 8.2 Assertions

- useful in large, complicated programs
- assertions for dev, not prod ( compile them out for performance)
- assertion != error, if assert not passed there is a bug not error
- **assert = error that should never occur**
- no executable code inside asserts

### 8.4 Exceptions

- use if can't handle error locally
- exception consistent with level of abstraction

### 8.6 Debugging Aids

- PROD constraints doesn't mean DEV constraints
  - trade speed and resources usage in DEV to use tools to aid development
